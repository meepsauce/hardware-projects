# Voltantex Ranger 2000

I smashed my brand new Voltantex Ranger 2000 into the ground, after owning it for 3 days. Luckily only two things broke: the internal wooden mounting sled, and the spar(s). Everything else was magically fine. Not finding any quick replacements online, I decided to CAD my own mount, and print it in PLA.
